								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I know if I'm asexual?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>To make things easier, asexuality was given a standard definition. The current definition of asexuality is ‘someone who does not experience sexual attraction’. This is the official definition given be AVEN. However asexuality is a wide spectrum and differs from person to person in terms of attraction, arousal and relationships. Thus it is only you who can decide what label fits you best. We hope that with the help of this website as well as other resources like AVEN will help you decide whether you are asexual or not.</p>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> I've never been sexually attracted to anyone. Am I an asexual?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>Again, it is completely up to you if you want to identify as asexual. However, according to the definition, yes you are an Ace. Note that it is lack of sexual attraction and not lack of sexual activity that defines asexuality.</p>
								</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I find people attractive, but have no sexual feelings towards them. What am I?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>It is absolutely normal for an asexual to admire someone who is aesthetically attractive. It's the same with sexual people. People sometimes form a platonic relationship and that's absolutely normal. If you are romantically connected to someone and still don't have sexual feelings, you might be an asexual.</p>
								</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I am very rarely sexually attracted to people. I have only been sexually attracted to two people in my entire life. Where do I stand?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>As mentioned above, asexuality is a wide spectrum and cannot be reduced to a black and white definition. In this vast spectrum, at one end is the sexual and the other end is the asexual. The area in between is the grey area. People who normally do not experience sexual attraction but sometimes do experience it, experience sexual attraction but have a low sex drive, enjoy and desire sex only under limited and specific circumstances, all come within this grey area. Furthermore, an asexual person can want or choose to engage in sex for several reasons. Some asexual people in relationships might choose or even want to have sex with their partner as a way of showing affection, and they might even enjoy it. Others may want to have sex in order to have children, or to satisfy a curiosity, or for other reasons.It is also important to keep in mind that sexuality can be fluid. Sexual inclination and identity may, but does not always, change over a period of time. In the end, privately or publicly identifying as asexual or sexual is your choice. No one can force a label on you that you are not sure of or comfortable with yourself.</p>

								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I get attracted to people only after a get to know them. What does this mean?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>There are different forms of attraction. Many sexual people find that they need to get to know someone in order to feel romantically and/or sexually attracted to them. In fact, some people identify as demi-sexual, which is a label used by people in the gray area when they can only feel sexual attraction after having a strong emotional bond with someone.Many asexual people as well need to get to know someone before feeling romantically attracted to them. Some use the label demi-romantic if they need a strong emotional bond (like friendship for example) before feeling romantic attraction. It is common for Asexuals to be intellectually attracted to someone after getting to know them as a friend (although 'love at first conversation' is perfectly possible).</p>

								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Certain things turn me on, but have nothing to do with people. What does that mean?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>Experiencing sexual arousal does not mean that you are not an Asexual. Several Asexuals have fetishes that does not involve attraction towards other people. Such Asexuals do not find the need to share their sexuality with anyone else.</p>
									<p>People form identities around stuff that they need to figure out. People who identify as asexual tend to be trying to figure out how to live full emotionally complete lives without necessarily having to engage in sexual relationships with other people, how to live in a world that places a high premium on sexuality and sexual relationships. If this is something that you are struggling with in some way, then the asexual community is worth investigating.</p>
									<p>Some asexuals have no sexual feelings at all (theyre called non-libidoists), but they eventually have a lot in common with those asexuals who have sexual feelings that do not involve people in any way. Both groups may feel alienated in a society that expects everyone to be sexually interested in other people.</p>
									<p>Eventually, whether or not you choose to identify as asexual is up to you, if you find the label useful.</p>

								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My sexuality comes in phases. Sometimes I'm sexual, other times I'm completely asexual. Do I have a place in your asexual community?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>Yes you do! This would put you in the grey area between sexuality and asexuality. The gray area also includes people who rarely experience sexual attraction. If you think this is a phase and could experience sexual attraction in the future, you still have a lot to relate to in the asexual community. AVEN has quite a few gray-a member with whom you might have a lot in common, particularly during your asexual moments.</p>

								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Am I Asexual if I masturbate or have sexual fantasies?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">
									<p>Most asexuals are physically capable of sex. Some masturbate and some do not. Since masturbation produces a pleasurable sensation, many asexuals choose to use it to take pleasure from their bodies. Some asexuals can only arouse themselves manually (by applying friction to sexual organs), while others can turn themselves on with thought or even outside stimulus, such as pornography or erotic literature.</p>
									<p>There is an important distinction between sexual and asexual people when it comes to masturbation: while some asexuals don't think about anything specifically sexual during masturbation, if they do think about other people or view pornography, these interpersonal interactions are only fantasy. If an asexual were actually given the opportunity to be sexual with the fantasized person(s), there would be no sexual attraction, or the attraction would be so low as to be completely ignorable.</p>
									<p>Some masturbating asexuals do not have a sex drive motivating them; they just do it because it's nice or to relieve stress. Other asexuals masturbate because they have a personal sex drive (libido) that they wish to take care of privately; they may experience arousal as a biological response to outside stimulus and wish to relieve themselves of it without a desire for partnered sex. Still more, some asexuals may be considered autosexual; they are sexually attracted to themselves and as such take sexual pleasure from their own bodies. The common factor is that all asexuals, masturbating or not, have little or no sexual attraction to other people.</p>
